# Community Guidelines

The SimplePie community has the goal of building tools for working with feeds. Collectively we will develop in the open, with contributions from anyone who wishes to participate. This guideline document describes how the SimplePie community is organized so that we can work together.

## Communication

SimplePie is developed in the open, and all technical or administrative topics about the projects should happen in their respective _Issues_ tabs. Topics about community processes should be directed to the [Community Issues](https://github.com/simplepie/community/issues). Public conversations are encouraged, and active developers of SimplePie should monitor the relevant _Issues_.

## Community Structure

Advancing SimplePie with a coherent, clear view of its evolution requires strong leadership. As these projects grow, leadership will be taken from the community, and will work closely with the much broader group of contributors and users.

### Project Lead

Ryan Parman is the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) and serves as the arbiter for the project. The project lead makes senior appointments to leadership roles, with those leaders coming from the worldwide SimplePie community of contributors. The community leaders and code contributors work together to continually improve SimplePie, and the project will advance by the good works of everyone involved.

### Core Team

* Ryan Parman (@skyzyx)

### Code Owners

Anyone can review a piece of code, and we welcome code review from everyone that is interested. Code review procedures are not dictated by a central, global policy. Instead, the process is defined by each code owner.

Any community member that is active and shows themselves to be valuable can offer to become a code owner, or be nominated by another member. If fellow contributors agree, the project lead will make the appointment and add the new owner’s name to the code owners file. The position is completely voluntary, and can be resigned at any time.

The list of current code owners can be found in the file `CODE_OWNERS` in the root of the individual project's source tree.

## License

The _original_ SimplePie project is provided under the terms of the [3-clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

SimplePie NG is comprised of a series of repositories and sub-projects (e.g., `FeedLocator`, `TextEncoder`, `UtilityPack`). It is provided under the terms of the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.md). The Apache 2.0 license was chosen because it allows broad use of SimplePie, and is already well-understood by many potential contributors.

Copyright is held by the authors of the contributions, or the company or organization to which the individual belongs. A list of copyright holders will be maintained in the `CONTRIBUTORS` file at the root of the repository.

Each contributor is responsible for adding his or her name to the `CONTRIBUTORS` file at the project’s root and maintaining the contact information. If you are contributing under the umbrella of your company, please add your company’s information, and do not also list yourself as an additional copyright holder.
