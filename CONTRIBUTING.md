# Contributing

The SimplePie Core Team welcomes everyone interested in the project. Members of the community can greatly help SimplePie by filing and screening bugs, aiding in code review, participating in open conversations, and of course by contributing code.

## Getting Started

It is highly recommended that you become familiar with using SimplePie in your own projects before contributing directly to the code itself. We put together handy Getting Started guides with step-by-step instructions to get you up and running.

## Contributing Code

SimplePie's website exists primarily to welcome contributions from the community. In the simplest cases, one-off patches are welcome from everyone. However, regular contributors are expected to adopt processes that help create a culture of quality within the project.

We ask that contributors first read through the content in the Contributing section of this site. This content includes detailed instructions on the process to follow when contributing a patch, including creating a pull request to get your code into the main SimplePie code base.

Bugs for the various SimplePie projects are managed in the issue trackers of their respective repositories. Anyone can file bugs, or view them to find where they can help, or to see if a bug they found is already filed.

## Proposing New Features

New features or directions for SimplePie can come from anyone with a good idea. Open discussion and iteration over the ideas in a public forum is essential to reaching the best possible solutions.

We are considering implementing a _SimplePie Proposal_ process to help evolve and improve the software over time. If we decide to move forward, we will provide more information about this over time.
