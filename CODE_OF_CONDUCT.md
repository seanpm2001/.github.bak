# Code of Conduct

To be a truly great community, SimplePie needs to welcome developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work diligently to make the SimplePie community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, SimplePie has adopted the code of conduct defined by <https://www.contributor-covenant.org>. This document is used across many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values well. The full text is copied below:

## Contributor Covenant v1.4

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project lead at <ryan@ryanparman.com>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html>

For answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq>.

## Reporting

A working group of community members is committed to promptly addressing any reported issues. Working group members are volunteers appointed by the project lead, with a preference for individuals with varied backgrounds and perspectives. Membership is expected to change regularly, and may grow or shrink.

We ask that you report concerns by sending an email to the working group rather than to any individual member. If you would like to volunteer to participate in the working group, please contact the working group.
